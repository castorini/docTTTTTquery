# docTTTTTquery

docTTTTTquery is the latest version of doc2query family of document expansion models.
The basic idea is to train a model, that when given an input document, generates questions that the document might answer (or more broadly, queries for which the document might be relevant).
These predicted questions (or queries) are then appended to the original documents, which are then indexed as before.
docTTTTTquery gets its name from the use of T5 as the expansion model.

The primary advantage of this approach is that expensive neural inference is pushed to _indexing time_, which means that "bag of words" queries against an inverted index built on the augmented document collection are only slightly slower (due to longer documents) &mdash; but the retrieval results are _much_ better.
Of course, these documents can be further reranked by another neural model in a multi-stage ranking architecture.

The results on the MS MARCO show that docTTTTTquery is as effective as the best non-BERT ranking model while increasing latency (time to retrieve 1000 docs per query) only slightly compared to vanila BM25:

## Instalation

T5 only works on TPUs (and consequently Google Cloud machines) so this installation must be performed on a Google Cloud instance.
You first need to install t5 (please check the [original T5 repository](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer) for updated installation instructions):
```
pip install t5[gcp]
```

You also need to install [Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/anserini) for indexing and retrieving documents:
```
sudo apt-get install maven
git clone https://github.com/castorini/Anserini.git
cd Anserini
mvn clean package appassembler:assemble
tar xvfz eval/trec_eval.9.0.4.tar.gz -C eval/ && cd eval/trec_eval.9.0.4 && make
cd ../ndeval && make
```

## Training T5

The following command will train a T5-base model for 4k iterations to predict queries from documents. We assume you put the tsv training file in `gs://your_bucket/data/doc_query_pairs.train.tsv`. Also, please change `your_tpu_name`, `your_project_id`, and `your_bucket` accordingly. . 

```
t5_mesh_transformer  \
  --tpu="your_tpu_name" \
  --gcp_project="your_project_id" \
  --tpu_zone="us-central1-b" \
  --model_dir="gs://your_bucket/models/" \
  --gin_param="init_checkpoint = 'gs://t5-data/pretrained_models/base/model.ckpt-999900'" \
  --gin_file="dataset.gin" \
  --gin_file="models/bi_v1.gin" \
  --gin_file="gs://t5-data/pretrained_models/base/operative_config.gin" \
  --gin_param="utils.tpu_mesh_shape.model_parallelism = 1" \
  --gin_param="utils.tpu_mesh_shape.tpu_topology = '2x2'" \
  --gin_param="utils.run.train_dataset_fn = @t5.models.mesh_transformer.tsv_dataset_fn" \
  --gin_param="tsv_dataset_fn.filename = 'gs://your_bucket/data/doc_query_pairs.train.tsv'" \
  --gin_file="learning_rate_schedules/constant_0_001.gin" \
  --gin_param="run.train_steps = 1004000" \
  --gin_param="tokens_per_batch = 131072"
```

## Download Predicted Queries

Download `predicted_queries_topk_sampling.zip` using one of the options above.
This file contains 80 sampled queries draw with the top-_k_ sampling decoder.

## Expanding documents
Before appending the sampled queries to the documents, we need to concatenate them into a file that will contain all the samples for the same document in a single line:
```
for i in {000..017}; do
    echo "Processing chunk $i"
    paste -d" " predicted_queries_topk_sample???.txt${i}-1004000 \
    > predicted_queries_topk.txt${i}-1004000
done

cat predicted_queries_topk.txt???-1004000 > predicted_queries_topk.txt-1004000
```

We can now append those queries to the original documents:
```
TODO
```
